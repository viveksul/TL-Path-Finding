DL folder

The DL folder contains the jupyter notebooks for the DNN and Transfer learning.
The base model folder contains the base model which was trained on MATLAB generated data. Run the Project.ipynb to train and test the model. The train and test 
data should be in Excel files. The test files are present in the folder. The dataset cannot be be uploaded as it is too big. The train and test data can be generated using MATLAB (Data_gen.m and Test_Data_gen.m) and then placed in the corresponding folder. 

The Transfer learning folder contains the two TL applications on Node number and RBI variation. It further contains folders holding models trained from scratch and the TL models. The train and test datasets are also too big to be uploaded but the can be generated by the MATLAB code by setting the required parameter (like RBI = 0.6 or N = 20, etc.) then placed in the appropriate folder for the jupyter notebook code to run.

The Time Comp DL folder holds the notebook to compare the computation times.


MATLAB Folder

The d2d_MIMO_SINRm_BER_Exp.m file in the SE_analysis folder is used to study path length against SE, SINR margins and BER.

The priority_algo1.m is used to study algorithm 2. The cimulation is done for simple SISO, but the SE,EE can be increased by using MIMO

Algo3_and_4_a.m and Algo3_and_4_b.m are used to simulate the results for algorithm 3 and 4.
